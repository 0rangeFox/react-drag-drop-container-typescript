> A ReactJS library with Drag and Drop functionality for mouse and touch devices.

## 🔖 Description
The following library allows us to create Drag & Drop interactions more effectively and natively without using HTML5. This library was not made by me, but by [Peter Hollingsworth](https://github.com/peterh32), this is just maintenance and improvements of the [old library](https://github.com/peterh32/react-drag-drop-container).

## 💾 Installation
```bash
# NPM
npm install react-drag-drop-container-typescript

# Yarn
yarn add react-drag-drop-container-typescript
```

## ⌨️ Code example
```typescript jsx
import { DragDropContainer, DropTarget } from 'react-drag-drop-container-typescript';

<DragDropContainer targetKey="foo" >
    <div>Drag Me!</div>
</DragDropContainer>

<DropTarget targetKey="foo" >
    <p>I'm a valid drop target for the object above since we both have the same targetKey!</p>
</DropTarget>
```
